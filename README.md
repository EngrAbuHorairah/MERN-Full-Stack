# Project Overview: Building a Full-Stack Application with Express.js, MongoDB, and React

This project is a practice for developing a full-stack application using popular technologies like Express.js, MongoDB, and React. The practicing is organized into some modules, each focusing on a key aspect of the development process. Here's a brief summary of explored modules:

# MOdules:

## REST API with Express.js: 
The fundamentals of building a RESTful API using Express.js. Explored HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and created APIs for CRUD operations on a resource.

## Backend Directory Structure / MVC / Router: 
Explored the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and set up a directory structure for the server application. Understood the role of routers in handling routes independently.

## MongoDB: 
Explored MongoDB, a NoSQL database, and knew how to set up the database server using MongoDB community server package. Understood the MongoDB structure, including database, collection, and document.

## Mongoose and REST APIs: 
Integrate Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, into your project. Create, read, update, and delete operations using Mongoose for a more structured interaction with the database.

## React Integration and MERN Stack Live Deployment: 
Connected the React front-end with the Express.js backend. Explore deployment options using platforms like Vercel. Understood the challenges of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and how to handle them.

## Server Side Rendering: 
Implemented server-side rendering using EJS (Embedded JavaScript). Explored about passing data from the server to the front end, handling HTML forms, and deploying server-rendered pages.

## Authentication with JWT: 
Implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Understood the process of generating and verifying tokens, along with password hashing for enhanced security.

## Mongoose Advanced Queries, Node Streams, Events, etc.: 
Explored advanced MongoDB queries, node events, and streams. Learn how to sort, paginate, and use population in Mongoose queries. Understood the basics of Node events and streams.

## Deployment and Sessions: 
Checked about deploying applications on platforms like Vercel and Heroku. Explored the use of session middleware for handling user sessions on the server side.

## Socket.IO and File Uploads: 
Explored real-time communication using Socket.IO for a simple group chat application. Knew about uploading files to the server using the Multer middleware.
